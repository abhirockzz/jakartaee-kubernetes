# Effective Kubernetes for Jakarta EE and MicroProfile Developers

There are several key techniques to understand while using Kubernetes with Jakarta EE and MicroProfile applications. Examples include:

* How Kubernetes cluster deployments align with application server administration, clustering, auto-discovery, and load-balancing.
* How to monitor and self-heal applications using health checks, metrics and Prometheus.
* How the CI/CD pipeline of your application can be adapted to Kubernetes.
* What role Kubernetes Controllers play in helping manage application server clusters.

This fast-paced, demo-driven session walks through each of these considerations in turn.
